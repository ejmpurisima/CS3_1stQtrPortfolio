The SONA 2025 gave a clear picture of where the Philippines is headed in terms of development. It showed a clear effort in our priorities like education, anti-corruption, sovereignty, and disaster-relief programs. PBBM also admitted to having disappointed Filipinos with his lack of action for the past three years. However, his aspirational tone and goals revealed his vision for a new Philippines and promised a significant impact over the next three years.

Some announcements were oddly placed in a formal national policy speech. Our country is facing pressing problems, including poverty, climate threats, and inflation, yet unnecessary initiatives downplay those realities. We should focus more on realistic timelines and impact rather than idealistic and overly ambitious projects. Overall, progress is within reach—−as long as leadership stays grounded and consistent.
