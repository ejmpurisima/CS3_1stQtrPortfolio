# Q1 End of Lessons Reflection Paper

## 9-Potassium

### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Arithmetic Operators:** The operators are usually used in real life math and that's why I know them very well. In my last two years of CS, we also already discussed these operators in programming languages.
2. **Loops:** While and for loops used to be a weakness, but I realized that they are a big part of my foundation in CS. If I don't know how to use them to my code's advantage, I will not be able to progress. They're good for organization and completeness of everything.
3. **Variables:** Again, this is an essential to every programming language. This topic is the first to learn every year, and this year, it's even more important because JS is case-sensitive. I know how to manipulate and update them respectively as well.
4. ** 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
