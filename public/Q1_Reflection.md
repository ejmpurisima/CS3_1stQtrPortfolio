### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Arithmetic Operators:** The operators are usually used in real life math and that's why I know them very well. In my last two years of CS, we also already discussed these operators in programming languages.
2. **For Loops:** For loops used to be a weakness, but I realized that they are a big part of my foundation in CS. If I don't know how to use them to my code's advantage, I will not be able to progress. They're good for organization and completeness of everything.
3. **Variables:** Again, this is an essential to every programming language. This topic is the first to learn every year, and this year, it's even more important because JS is case-sensitive. I know how to manipulate and update them respectively as well.
4. **Conditional Statements:** Whenever I doubt myself in CS, I know that I don't doubt my ability in these two. Again, for the past two years, we've been discussing conditional statements, especially if-else statements. All the statements are part of foundations for CS, and it is very helpful to me to control conditions.
5. **Output in the Alert Dialog Boxes:** This was when Ma'am Aline taught us how to do alert prompts in websites. I thought it was really cool because it was new to me. Now, I'm confident on how to generate one and what kind of output I expect.


### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Relational and Logical Operators:** JS made me realize how important these operators are. As I learned in class, there is a certain order of priority and strictness when it comes to these operators. I was having trouble with the equal signs, especially !x, but now I finally understand them. 
2. **Arrays:** Arrays has been my favorite lesson since C++. In JS, there are other different ways to modify and manipulate them. But in general, I still need to practice and remember the "push", "unshift", and even the placements of my elements.
3. **Input/Output:** User input and output are still very confusing to me, especially the pre-defined functions in JS. I can only use pre-set inputs and not user inputs.
4. **Functions:** In general, even in C++, I still have trouble with this topic. It's hard for me to put the procedure and even call them.
5. **While Loops:** Unlike for loops, I still have trouble with while loops because of the condition. Personally, for loops are more direct because of the initialization, condition, and update in just the parentheses.


### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. I will memorize and remember the order of priority and also what the operators indicate.
2. I will memorize the modifications and what they do, and study how loops go hand-in-hand with arrays with accessibility.
3. For inputs and values, I will study the number methods. And for outputs, I need to practice the pre-defined functions like the readline, etc.
4. Functions require practice on making them and calling them. I think if I practice more user-defined and void functions in general, I will get used to it and even improve on how I use them.
5. For while and do-while loops, I need more understanding on how they work in general. The iterations and conditions confuse me.


### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. The 3 review challenges of loops and arrays + the bonus guessing game really helped me understand how they work in general. I think they helped me most in reviewing because I just had to go back to them.
2. Sir Roy helped us understand switch statements deeper, and I think I understood how to take in multiple values at once to generate one compound output.
