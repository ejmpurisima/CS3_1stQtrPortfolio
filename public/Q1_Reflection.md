### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Arithmetic Operators:** The operators are usually used in real life math and that's why I know them very well. In my last two years of CS, we also already discussed these operators in programming languages.
2. **Loops:** While and for loops used to be a weakness, but I realized that they are a big part of my foundation in CS. If I don't know how to use them to my code's advantage, I will not be able to progress. They're good for organization and completeness of everything.
3. **Variables:** Again, this is an essential to every programming language. This topic is the first to learn every year, and this year, it's even more important because JS is case-sensitive. I know how to manipulate and update them respectively as well.
4. **Conditional Statements:** Whenever I doubt myself in CS, I know that I don't doubt my ability in these two. Again, for the past two years, we've been discussing conditional statements, especially if-else statements. All the statements are part of foundations for CS, and it is very helpful to me to control conditions.
5. **Output in the Alert Dialog Boxes:** This was when Ma'am Aline taught us how to do alert prompts in websites. I thought it was really cool because it was new to me. Now, I'm confident on how to generate one and what kind of output I expect.

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Relational and Logical Operators:** JS made me realize how important these operators are. As I learned in class, there is a certain order of priority and strictness when it comes to these operators. I was having trouble with the equal signs, especially !x, but now I finally understand them. 
2. **Arrays:** 


### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
